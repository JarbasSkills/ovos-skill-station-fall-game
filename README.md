## Station Fall

What a trotting krip! Since your incredible heroics in Planetfall, where you risked life and limb to save the planet Resida, things have hardly changed at all. 

## Description

![](http://infocom.elsewhere.org/gallery/stationfall/stationfall1.jpg)

Sure, you were promoted to Lieutenant First Class, but this only meant that your dull life of cleaning grotch cages was replaced by an equally dull life of paperwork. Now you've got another assignment tailor- made for a grotchbrain: pilot a spacetruck to a nearby station to pick up a load of trivial forms. Trot and double trot!

As far as I know, Activision have still not declared the games abandonware. 

But I do not believe that it is in the spirit of copyright law that works of art drift into oblivion by unavailability. 
 
The day the games are republished in their old glory, I will gladly remove the files from this repository. Until then, I hope they will be allowed to remain here so you can have fun playing them in a novel way.
